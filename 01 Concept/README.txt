Section:
Conceptualisation

About:
In this section we will develop a concept using creative techniques such as mind maps based upon our pre-decided subject (reducing human impact on the environment). We will also ensure that this concept is possible and necessary by doing extensive research into the subject matter, our app's potential impact and the technology available to us.
